dotfiles
========

My primary system is a mid-2011 model Macbook Air currently running OSX 10.9.3. Here I keep the important dotfiles as backup and for others to use. Enjoy. 

Installation
============
- clone the repo in the home directory
- Use the provided install.sh script to symlink the files to the home directory
- enjoy

What's included
=======


- bashrc : Stairforward aliases only for bash. 
- vimrc : I am currently using VIM 7.3 with no additional plugins. I like to keep it simple so that I can easily adapt to new systems without too much plugin swocery. 
- zshrc : Zsh is my default shell with iTerm 2.0. There is no real customisation in it per se, apart from what is being done in .bashrc. I use the git plugin with oh-my-zsh and apart from that fairly standard stuff. Not much customisation so far. 
- slate.js [Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate) is an integral part of my daily life. It a [hacker's window manager](http://thume.ca/howto/2012/11/19/using-slate/). The technology is at its best when it simply fades into background. Slate has nailed it. 

These are my slate bindings. The setup is roughly based on Christan Mohn's [My Slate Setup](http://vninja.net/osx/slate-setup/)

These bindings assume a remapped [CapsLock key](http://www.tenshu.net/2012/11/using-caps-lock-as-new-modifier-key-in.html).

These bindings are meant to be changed or tinkered with based on the apps you use the most.
