my dotfiles file
==============

My primary system is a mid-2011 model Macbook Air currently running OSX 10.9.3. Here I keep the important dotfiles as backup and for others to use. Enjoy. 

Vim
===

I am currently using VIM 7.3 with no additional plugins. I like to keep it simple so that I can easily adapt to new systems without too much plugin swocery. 

Zsh
===

Zsh is my default shell with iTerm 2.0. 

Oh-my-zsh

Slate
=====
[Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate) is an integral part of my daily life. It a [hacker's window manager](http://thume.ca/howto/2012/11/19/using-slate/). The technology is at its best when it simply fades into background. Slate has nailed it. 

These are my slate bindings. The setup is roughly based on Christan Mohn's [My Slate Setup](http://vninja.net/osx/slate-setup/)

These bindings assume a remapped [CapsLock key](http://www.tenshu.net/2012/11/using-caps-lock-as-new-modifier-key-in.html).

These bindings are meant to be changed or tinkered with based on the apps you use the most.

Usage
=

Place the .slate file in your home directory. Make sure to keep a backup of your original file. Then from the Slate menu do "Relaunch and Load Config".
