slate-bindings
==============
[Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate) is an integral part of my daily life. It a [hacker's window manager](http://thume.ca/howto/2012/11/19/using-slate/). The technology is at its best when it simply fades into background. Slate has nailed it. 

These are my slate bindings. The setup is roughly based on Christan Mohn's [My Slate Setup](http://vninja.net/osx/slate-setup/)

These bindings assume a remapped [CapsLock key](http://www.tenshu.net/2012/11/using-caps-lock-as-new-modifier-key-in.html).

These bindings are meant to be changed or tinkered with based on the apps you use the most.

Usage
=

Place the .slate file in your home directory. Make sure to keep a backup of your original file. Then from the Slate menu do "Relaunch and Load Config".
