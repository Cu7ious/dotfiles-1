slate-bindings
==============
[Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate) is an integral part of my daily life. These are my slate bindings. 

These bindings assume a remapped [CapsLock key](http://www.tenshu.net/2012/11/using-caps-lock-as-new-modifier-key-in.html).

These bindings are meant to be changed or tinkered with based on the apps you use the most.

Usage
=

Place the .slate file in your home directory. Make sure to keep a backup of your original file. Then from the Slate menu do "Relaunch and Load Config".
