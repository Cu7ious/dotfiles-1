{"name":"Dotfiles","tagline":"","body":"dotfiles\r\n========\r\n\r\nI am running Xcode version 7.0.1 (7A1001) on OS X version 10.10.5. Hardware is MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013) with 2.7 GHz Intel Core i7 and 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3. Here I keep the important dotfiles as backup and for others to use. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n- clone the repo in the home directory\r\n- Use the provided install.sh script to symlink the files to the home directory\r\n- enjoy\r\n\r\nWhat's included\r\n=======\r\n\r\n\r\n- bashrc : Stairforward aliases only for bash. \r\n- vimrc : I am currently using VIM 7.3 with no additional plugins. I like to keep it simple so that I can easily adapt to new systems without too much plugin swocery. \r\n- zshrc : Zsh is my default shell with iTerm 2.0. There is no real customisation in it per se, apart from what is being done in .bashrc. I use the git plugin with oh-my-zsh and apart from that fairly standard stuff. Not much customisation so far. \r\n- .slate [Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate) is an integral part of my daily life. It a [hacker's window manager](http://thume.ca/howto/2012/11/19/using-slate/). The technology is at its best when it simply fades into background. Slate has nailed it. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
